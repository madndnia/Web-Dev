        <p id = "b">In this post, I want to talk about my journey in learning web development. It's been a fascinating experience so far, diving into HTML, CSS, and even exploring JavaScript. The process of building websites from scratch is not only fun but also rewarding.

I’ve recently started learning through a variety of online platforms, and the progress has been great. One of the key challenges I’ve faced is understanding how the front-end and back-end of a website work together, but I’m learning more every day. I’m also experimenting with creating my own projects, which I hope to showcase in future posts.

If you're also learning web development, feel free to share your experiences and tips with me! Let's grow together. </p>
