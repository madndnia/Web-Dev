        <h1>The perfect trip</h1>
        <p>The perfect trip can vary depending on personal interests. For me, the ideal trip consists of the following things: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Landscapes</li>
                <li>Wildlife</li>
                <li>Cuisine</li>
            </ul>
        <p><strong>I would see scenes like:
        </strong>
        <img src = "https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/landscapes/mountains-sunset.png" alt = "Sunset" width ="350"><br> 
        <em>Sunset over the Serengeti:</em> Vast, golden plains stretching as far as the eye can see, with acacia trees silhouetted against the vibrant orange and pink hues of the setting sun.</p>
        
        <p><strong>And animals like:</strong><img src = "https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/animals/penguins.png" alt = "Penguins" width = "350"><br>
            <em>Penguins in Antarctica: </em>Witnessing colonies of penguins waddling on icy landscapes, a truly unique and breathtaking sight.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>And eat food like:</strong>
        <img src = "https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/food/sushi.png" alt = "Sushi" width = "350"><br>
            <em>Sushi in Japan:</em> Fresh, melt-in-your-mouth sushi made from the finest fish, served with precision at a high-end sushi bar.
