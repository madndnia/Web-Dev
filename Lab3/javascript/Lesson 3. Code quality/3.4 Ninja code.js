/* LESSON SUMMARY:
1. Brevity is the soul of wit: make the code as short as possible
2. One-letter variables: use single-letter variables but never use i as the counter in a 'for' loop
3. Use abbreviations: for example browser->brsr
4. Soar high, be abstract: while choosing a name use the most abstract word like 'obj', 'data'
5. Attention test: use similar variable names to make sure only attentive ones understand your code
6. Smart synonyms: using similar names for smae things makes life more interesting
7. Reuse names: reuse existing names, just write new values into them
8. Underscores for fun: you kill two rabbits with one shot
9. Show your love: have fun and be creative, show how magnificent your entities are!
10. Overlap outer variables: use same names for variables inside and outside a function
11. Side-effects everywhere: add surprise - return a non-standard result or add a 'useful' action to functions that look like they don't calculate anything
12. Powerful functions: joining several actions into one protects your code  from reuse

All “pieces of advice” above are from the real code… Sometimes, written by experienced developers. Maybe even more experienced than you are ;)

Follow some of them, and your code will become full of surprises.
Follow many of them, and your code will become truly yours, no one would want to change it.
Follow all, and your code will become a valuable lesson for young developers looking for enlightenment.
