/* LESSON SUMMARY:
Destructuring assignment allows for instantly mapping an object or array onto many variables.

The full object syntax:

let {prop : varName = defaultValue, ...rest} = object
This means that property prop should go into the variable varName and, if no such property exists, then the default value should be used.

Object properties that have no mapping are copied to the rest object.

The full array syntax:

let [item1 = defaultValue, item2, ...rest] = array
The first item goes to item1; the second goes into item2, and all the rest makes the array rest.

Itâ€™s possible to extract data from nested arrays/objects, for that the left side must have the same structure as the right one.
